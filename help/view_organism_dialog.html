<A NAME="TOC1"></A><h2> Examine  Organism  Dialog</h2><p>
 When  you  double-click  on  an  organism,  this  dialog  will  appear.  This  dialog  shows  the  inner  details  of  an  organism.
</p>
<IMG  SRC="ViewOrganism.jpg"><p>
 The  ORGANISM  area  of  this  dialog  displays  stuff  common  to  the  entire  organism.  The  CELL  area  displays  the  stuff  unique
 to  that  cell.  To  examine  different  cells,  click  on  the  cell  you  want  to  view.
</p>
<A NAME="TOC2"></A><h2> ORGANISM</h2><p>
 This  section  shows  various  details  about  the  organism.  The  genetic  program  (which  is  shared  among  all  the  cells)  is  shown
 in  the  text  control.  The  highlighted  instruction  is  where  the  selected  cell  is  currently  executing.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b> Organism  ID:</b> Every  organism  is  assigned  a  unique  64-bit  ID  number.  This  ID  increments  as  organisms  are  created.  This  field  displays
 this  organisms  unique  ID.
</li>

<li>
<b> Parent  1:</b> ID  value  for  the  first  parent  (and  only  parent  if  this  organism  was  created  asexually).
</li>

<li>
<b> Parent  2:</b> ID  value  for  the  second  parent  (if  this  organism  was  created  sexually).  It  will  be  blank  if  this  organism
 was  created  asexually.
</li>

<li>
<b> Generation</b> The  generation  of  this  organism  all  the  way  back  to  the  first  organism.  We  compute  this  field  based  on
 the  parents &#x27;generation&#x27;: 
<pre>
generation = MAX(parent1.generation, parent2.generation) + 1
</pre>

</li>

<li>
<b>#  of  cells:</b> The  number  of  cells  in  this  organism.
</li>

<li>
<b> #  of  living  children:</b> number  of  organism  that  have  this  organism  as  a  parent.
</li>

<li>
<b> Age:</b> The  number  of  simulation  steps  this  organism  has  survived  through.
</li>

<li>
<b> Energy:</b> How  much  energy  does  this  organism  have?  The  first  number  is  energy <b>per  cell</b>.  The  second  number  is  total
 energy  for  the  entire  organism.  Energy  per  cell  is  calculated  by <tt>total_energy  /  number_of_cells</tt>. <p>
<i>Energy  per  cell</i> is  useful  to  see  because  the <tt>EAT,  GROW,  MAKE-SPORE</tt> instructions  use  it.
</p>

</li>

<li>
<b> G0:</b> This  is  the  simulation-wide  global  variable.
</li>

<li>
<b> S0:</b> This  is  the  per  strain  global  variable.
</li>
</ul><A NAME="TOC3"></A><h2> CELL</h2><p>
 This  section  shows  the  state  of  the  cell  you  have  selected  in  the  display  window.  Use  your  mouse  to  select
 different  cells.  The  current  cell  is  highlighted  with  a  blue  rectangle.
</p>
<p>
 These  fields  comprise  the &quot;execution  context&quot;.  Each  cell  has  its  own  copy  of  these  fields:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b> Code  Block:</b> This  specifies  the  code  block  currently  being  executed  by  this  cell.  Code  block  numbers  begin  at  0.  Code  block
 zero  is  normally  labeled &quot;main:&quot;,  and  subsequent  code  blocks  are  labeled &quot;row1,  row2,  row3, ...&quot;.
</li>

<li>
<b> Program  Counter:</b> This  is  the  instruction  offset  within  the  code  block.  This  counter  begins  at  0.  If  program  counter  refers  to
 the  last  instruction  plus  1,  then  this  cell  has  just  reached  the  end  of  a  code  block.
</li>

<li>
<b> R0  -  R9:</b> General  Purpose  registers.  Can  be  set  with  the  instructions <b>Rn!,  R0!,  R1!,  R2!, ...</b> and  the  cell  can  fetch  a  register  value  with
 the  instructions <b>Rn,  R0,  R1,  R2, ...</b>.
</li>

<li>
<b> Mood:</b> This  is  like  a  general  purpose  register.  The  cell  can  set  this  field  by  using  the <b>MOOD!</b> instruction.  Other
 cells  can  query  our  mood  by  using  the <b>MOOD</b> instruction.
</li>

<li>
<b> Location:</b> The  grid  location  of  this  cell.
</li>

<li>
<b> Message:</b> Like  a  general  purpose  register  except  other  cells  can  set  this  field  by  using  the <b>SEND</b> and <b>BROADCAST</b> instructions.
 This  cell  can  fetch  the  value  of  this  field  by  using  the <b>RECV</b> instruction.
</li>

<li>
<b> Cell:</b> The  cell  number  within  the  organism.
</li>

<li>
<b> Data  Stack:</b> Like  the  Forth  programming  language,  this  stack  is  used  to  keep  track  of  data  items  that  the  cell  is
 using  for  computation.  The  top  of  this  list  box  represents  the  top  of  the  stack.
</li>

<li>
<b> Call  Stack:</b> Like  the  Forth  programming  language,  this  stack  contains  the  call  history.  As  code  blocks  are  entered/exited  this  stack  grows
 The  top  of  this  list  box  represents  the  top  of  the  stack.and  shrinks.
</li>
</ul><A NAME="TOC4"></A><h2> BUTTONS:</h2><ul>
<li>
<b> Step:</b> This  button  will  simulate  the  universe  for  1  step.  The  current  instruction  about  to  execute  is  highlighted.  In  this
 way  you  can  observe  the  inner  workings  of  a  genetic  program.  (Function  key: <b>F7</b>).
</li>

<li>
<b> Step  Over:</b> This  button  will  simulate  the  universe  for  1  step,  but  step  over  any  subroutine  calls.  (Function  key: <b>F6</b>).
</li>

<li>
<b> Run:</b> Begin  running  the  program  (actually  this  begins  simulating  the  whole  universe).  Stop  when  the  cell  dies,  or  when  a
 breakpoint  is  reached.  (Function  key: <b>F5</b>).
</li>

<li>
<b> Breakpoint:</b> Insert  a  breakpoint  at  the  current  cursor  position.  Just  select  an  instruction  and  press  this  button.  A  breakpoint  will
 be  added  (or  removed).  A  breakpoint  will  show  up  as  a  vertical  bar &#x27;|&#x27; next  to  the  instruction. <p>
Breakpoints  only  apply  to  the  current  cell  being  debugged.  When  you  switch  cells,  the  breakpoints  are  retained,  and  will  be
 applied  to  the  new  cell.  (Function  key: <b>F9</b>).
</p>

</li>

<li>
<b> Clear  Breakpoints:</b> All  breakpoints  will  be  cleared.  (Function  key: <b>F8</b>).
</li>

<li>
<b> Instructions:</b> This  button  will  pop  up  a  list  of  KFORTH  instructions  for  your  reference.  Whatever  instruction  the  cursor  is  pointing
 to  will  be  displayed  in  the  KFORTH  Instruction  dialog.
</li>

<li>
<b> Save:</b> Save  the  current  KFORTH  program  showing  to  a  file.
</li>
</ul><HR>
