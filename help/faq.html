<A NAME="TOC1"></A><h1> Frequently  Asked  Questions</h1><HR>
<A NAME="TOC2"></A><h2> What  is  the  latest  version?</h2><p>
 The  latest  version  is  5.0 .  (Released  on:  February  15,  2023 )
</p>
<HR>
<A NAME="TOC3"></A><h2> What  is  Evolve?</h2><p>
 Evolve  5.0 is  an  artificial  life  simulator.
</p>
<p>
 It  is  a  mixture  of  Conway&#x27;s &quot;LIFE&quot; and &quot;Core  Wars&quot;.  Each  organism  has  a  genetic  program  which  controls  its  behavior.
 The  program  has  all  the  normal  types  of  instructions  you  would  expect  from  a  programming  language:  flow  control,  arithmetic,  subroutines,
 and  so  on.  But,  there  are  also  special  primitives  for  interacting  with  the  universe.  Such  as  EAT,  LOOK,  GROW,  MOVE,
 MAKE-SPORE.
</p>
<HR>
<A NAME="TOC4"></A><h2> Why  would  someone  use  this?</h2><p>
 Some  reasons,
</p>
<ol>
<li>
 Interested  in  seeing  evolution  unfold.
</li>

<li>

</li>

<li>
 Interested  in  swarm  intellegence.
</li>

<li>
 Interested  in  genetic  algorithms.
</li>

<li>
 Enjoy  programming  challenges.
</li>

<li>
 A  new  kind  of  core  wars  competition  platform.
</li>

<li>
 Teaching  low-level  programming  concepts.
</li>
</ol><CENTER><I> There  are  1,000  reasons  we  can  think  of  to  have  this...</I></CENTER><BR><CENTER><I>...  but  mostly  it&#x27;s  for  the  reasons  we  can&#x27;t  think  of.

<A NAME="TOC5"></A><h2> What  is  the  purpose  of  Evolve?</h2><p>
 My  goal  is  to  run  a  large-scale  simulation  and  see  evidence  of  really  cool  (perhaps  intellegent)  behavior.  And  then...  well,
 if  that  happens  I  will  enlist  my  ALife  creatures  to  do  my  taxes.
</p>
<HR>
<A NAME="TOC6"></A><h2> What  is  KFORTH?</h2><p>
 KFORTH  is  a  forth-like  language.  The &#x27;K&#x27; stands  for &quot;Ken&#x27;s&quot;.  So  KFORTH  means  Ken&#x27;s  Forth.  Woo  hoo.
</p>
<p>
 This  is  the  language  used  to  control  the  cells  in  the  simulator.  This  language  has  several  properties  that  make  it
 perfect  for  being  used  in  an  ALife  context.  It  is  simple  to  implement  and  parse.  It  has  a  very  simple
 instruction  set.  It  only  has  one  data  type  (which  is  a  16-bit  integer).  KFORTH  programs  compile  into  a  simple  row/column
 matrix  which  is  fast  and  easy  to  mutate.
</p>
<HR>
<A NAME="TOC7"></A><h2> Any  large-scale  simulations  happening?</h2><p>
 No.  Many  years  ago  in  2007  I  ran  a <b>&quot;One  Year  of  ALife&quot;</b> project.  I  had  a  dedicated  linux  box  that  ran  an
 Evolve  4.0  simulation  for  1  year.  Every  day  a  snapshot  is  uploaded  to  my  website.  I  never  completed  the  full
 year  as  the  simulation  got  stuck  and  uninteresting.  I  restarted  several  times.  I  think  the  most  was  like  50  days.
</p>
<p>
 With  the  new <b> Evolve  5.0</b> I  hope  to  get  the  chance  to  attempt  another  long  term  simulation.
</p>
<HR>
<A NAME="TOC8"></A><h2> Have  you  ever  seen  any  intellegent  behaviors  evolve  with  this  software?</h2><p>
 Sadly,  no.  But,  let  me  add  that  (1)  It  has  taken  lots  of  tweaking  to  get  to  the  current  version
 of  this  simulator.  And  (2)  only  now  that  I  have  a  dedicated  linux  box  can  I  run  this  in  the
 proper  time  frame  needed  to  see  cool  things  evolve.
</p>
<p>
 It  hasn&#x27;t  all  been  a  waste.  I  have  seen  the  essence  of  Darwinian  selection  many  times.  New  innovations  are  constantly
 evolving  and  displacing  other  creatures.  But  when  you  observe  their  behaviors  it  is  not &quot;mind-blowing&quot; or  clever  or  intellegent.
</p>
<p>
 My  personal  bench-mark  for  coolness  will  be  if  creatures  evolve  to  use  the &quot;LOOK&quot; instruction  and  actually  evade/hunt  other  creatures.
 If  this  kind  of  behavior  evolves  I  will  be  immensely  happy.
</p>
<HR>
<A NAME="TOC9"></A><h2> What  does  a  KFORTH  program  look  like?</h2><p>
 Here&#x27;s  a  sample:
</p>

<pre>
main:
{
	7 fact call
}

;
; Recursive factorial algorithm:
; ( n -- factorial(n) )
;
fact:
{
	dup 0 =
		{ pop 1 }
		{ dup 1 - fact call * } ifelse
}
</pre>
<p>
 The &#x27;fact&#x27; routine  computes  the  factorial.  This  is  how  humans  write  KFORTH.  But  names  like &#x27;fact&#x27; and &#x27;main&#x27; are  really
 labels  for  code  blocks,  which  make  it  easier  for  us  humans  to  write  in  KFORTH.  These  labels  are  mapped  to
 code  block  numbers  (main  is <b>0</b>,  and  fact  is <b>1</b>).
</p>
<p>
 Another  aid  for  humans  are  the  nested  code  blocks  like, <b><tt>{ pop  1 }</tt></b>.  Again,  when  compiled  these  nested  code  blocks  are
 pulled  out  and  put  into  their  own  code  block  with  their  own  code  block  number.  In  this  case <b><tt>{ pop  1 }</tt></b> becomes
 code  block <b>2</b>.
</p>
<p>
 Here  is  the  same  program  after  being  compiled:
</p>

<pre>
main:
{
	7 1 call
}

row1:
{
	dup 0 = 2 3 ifelse
}

row2:
{
	pop 1
}

row3:
{
	dup 1 - 1 call *
}
</pre>
<p>
 Notice  the  nice  grid-like  layout  of  compiled  KFORTH.  This  property  makes  it  easy  to  merge  2  programs  (during  sexual  recombination).
 Evolve  just  alternates  rows  of  code  blocks  to  form  a  new  child  program.
</p>
<p>
 (click <A HREF="genes.gif">here</A> to  see  a  graphical  representation  of  this  program  as  it  would  be  stored  internally)
</p>
<p>
 Also  notice  that  compiled  programs  have  no  real  syntax  requirements.  Each  row  is  simply  a  list  of  instructions  or  numbers.
 This  means  our  mutation  algorithm  will  be  simpler  because  it  doesn&#x27;t  have  to  worry  about  about  preserving  any  special  syntax
 crap.

</p>
<HR>
<A NAME="TOC10"></A><h2> What  does  an  evolved  KFORTH  program  look  like?</h2><p>
 Click <A HREF="evolved_kforth_samples.html">here</A> to  see  some  sample  KFORTH  programs  that  evolved  after  running  them  in  a  simulation.  These  KFORTH  programs  can
 actually  be  used  to  seed  your  own  simulations.
</p>
<HR>
<A NAME="TOC11"></A><h2> Does  KFORTH  support  recursion?</h2><p>
 Yes  it  does  (see  the  example  above).  This  was  the  biggest  limitation  of  my  previous  attempts  at  an  ALife  simulator.
 Previous  versions  used  a  gross  half-baked  assembly  language  with  a  fixed  sized  stack  (stack  size=4).
</p>
<HR>
<A NAME="TOC12"></A><h2> What  instructions  do  organisms  have?</h2><p>
 In  addition  to  all  the  normal  Forth-like  operators,  the  following  instructions  cause  the  Cell  executing  them  to  interact  with  the
 universe:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b> OMOVE:</b> Move  the  organism.
</li>

<li>
<b> ROTATE:</b> Rotate  the  organism  by  90  degree  units.
</li>

<li>
<b> CMOVE:</b> Move  a  cell  relative  to  the  organism
</li>

<li>
<b> CSHIFT:</b> Move  a  line  of  cells  relative  to  the  organism
</li>

<li>
<b> EAT:</b> Eat  edible  stuff  near  this  cell.
</li>

<li>
<b> MAKE-SPORE:</b> Create  a  spore  nearby
</li>

<li>
<b> SPAWN:</b> Create  a  new  organism  directly
</li>

<li>
<b> GROW:</b> Add  a  cell  to  our  organism
</li>

<li>
<b> LOOK:</b> Look  in  a  direction  and  return  what  was  seen  and  its  distance.
</li>

<li>
<b> WHERE:</b> return  distance  to  the  thing  seen  while  looking  in  a  specified  direction.
</li>

<li>
<b> WHAT:</b> return &#x27;what&#x27; value  of  the  thing  seen  while  looking  in  a  specified  direction.
</li>

<li>
<b> NEAREST:</b> return  direction  to  nearest  thing  after  looking  in  all  8  directions.
</li>

<li>
<b> FARTHEST:</b> return  direction  to  farthest  thing  after  looking  in  all  8  directions.
</li>

<li>
<b> MOOD:</b> query  the  mood  variable  of  another  cell  within  the  same  organism.
</li>

<li>
<b> MOOD!:</b> set  our  mood  variable.
</li>

<li>
<b> BROADCAST:</b> send  a  value  to  all  cell  within  the  same  organism.
</li>

<li>
<b> SEND:</b> send  a  value  to  a  particular  cell  (within  the  same  organism).
</li>

<li>
<b> RECV:</b> query  our  message  buffer  and  put  its  value  on  to  the  data  stack.
</li>

<li>
<b> AGE:</b> query  the  age  of  our  organism  (number  of  simulation  steps  the  organism  has  been  alive  for).  (&quot;How  old  am
 I?&quot;)
</li>

<li>
<b> NUM-CELLS:</b> query  the  number  of  cells  in  our  organism.  (&quot;How  big  am  I?&quot;)
</li>

<li>
<b> HAS-NEIGHBOR:</b> query  if  the  organism  has  a  neighboring  cell.
</li>
</ul><p>
 And  many  more...  See <A HREF="organisms.html#reference">this  page</A> to  learn  more  about <b>all</b> the  instructions.
</p>
<HR>
<A NAME="TOC13"></A><h2> Can  cells  communicate?</h2><p>
 Yes,  lots  of  ways.  Each  cell  has  a &quot;MOOD&quot; register,  which  only  they  can  set.  Other  cells  can  query  this
 MOOD  register.  I  guess  the  theory  being  that  a  creature  could  evolve  to  use  this  register.  If  it  was  in
&quot;EVADE&quot; mode,  or &quot;FORAGE&quot; mode,  it  could  set  its  mood,  and  the  other  cells  could  act  accordingly.
</p>
<p>
 Also,  every  cell  has  a  MESSAGE  register.  This  can  be  set  by  the  SEND  instruction,  which  allows  any  cell  to
 send  a  value  to  any  other  cell  (within  the  same  organism,  of  course).  The  organism  can  query  its  own  MESSAGE
 register  and  act  accordingly.  As  special  case,  the  BROADCAST  instruction  will  set  the  MESSAGE  register  for  all  cells  in  the
 organism.
</p>
<p>
 Lastly,  all  the  cells  share  the  same  program  memory,  which  can  be  written  to  as  well  as  read  from.
</p>
<p>
 I  provided  these  primitives  but  I  have  no  idea  if  anything  will  evolve  to  use  them.  My  experience  with  ALIFE
 simulators  indicates  that  what <b>I</b> think  is  a  useful  idea,  is  not  necessarily  what <b>evolution</b> will  think  is  useful.  More
 information  on  communicating  between  cells  is  available <A HREF="organisms.html#cellular_communications">here</A>.
</p>
<HR>
<A NAME="TOC14"></A><h2> How  do  you  limit/prevent  runaway  stack  growth?</h2><p>
 The  kforth  machine  used  by  each  cell  has  a  fixed  call  stack  and  fixed  data  stack  (<b>64</b> elements  each).
 To  limit  growth  the  CPU  simply  stops  pushing  items  on  the  stack,  basically  treating  all  instructions  as  NOP&#x27;s  unless  they
 pop  things  off  the  stack.
</p>
<HR>
<A NAME="TOC15"></A><h2> Do  any  simulations  die  off?</h2><p>
 Yes,  in  some  cases  the  simulation  will  reach  a  state  where  there  are  only  a  few  organisms,  and  they  don&#x27;t
 reproduce  for  some  reason  (they  are  stuck  in  the  wrong  part  of  their  genetic  program).
</p>
<p>
 When  energy  (and  population)  is  too  low  you  can  have  too  much  useful  energy  sitting  around  as  spores  or  organic
 material  and  not  enough  moving  creatures  to  eat  it.  So  yes,  some  simulations  will  peter  out.
</p>
<HR>
<A NAME="TOC16"></A><h2> Has  any  creature  evolved  to  LOOK  around?</h2><p>
 Yes,  it  is  common  nowadays.  In  older  versions  of  the  simulator  it  didn&#x27;t  occur.  The  vision  system  has  been  recently
 changed,  and  so  far  the  results  look  good.  But  in  the  previous  versions  LOOK&#x27;ing  around  was  rare.
</p>
<p>
 It  is  my  goal  to  see  creatures  evolve  that  will  make  heavy  use  of  the  vision  instructions.  For  me  this
 represents  a  special  kind  of  awareness  for  organisms.  I  believe  evolution  is  progressive,  in  the  sense  that  it  tends  to
 foster  more  and  more  awareness  in  creatures.  Humans  are  therefore  the  best  example  of  this  trend  in  evolution.  Hopefully  this
 simulator  will  demonstrate  a  similar  trend.
</p>
<HR>
<A NAME="TOC17"></A><h2> How  do  I  pan  the  simulation  window?</h2><p>
 Use  the  arrow  keys  to  scroll  the  window  when  you  are  zoomed  in.  Or  just  click  your  mouse  and  drag
 the  window.
</p>
<HR>
<A NAME="TOC18"></A><h2> How  do  I  create  barriers?</h2><p>
 Select  the  barrier  right  click  tool.  Now  right  click  inside  of  the  simulation  window  and  drag  your  mouse  to  draw
 a  barrier.  If  you  want  to  erase,  right  click  on  an  existing  barrier  first  (now  you&#x27;re  in  erase  mode).  See
 the  section  on <A HREF="barriers.html">barriers</A> for  more  information.
</p>
<HR>
<A NAME="TOC19"></A><h2> What  is  the  Simulation  file  format?</h2><p>
 The  format  is  a  self  describing  format  called &quot;Photon  Ascii&quot;.  Click <A HREF="ascii_example.html">here</A> to  see  an  example  of  the  ASCII  file
 format.
</p>
<HR>
<A NAME="TOC20"></A><h2> What  is &#x27;evolve_batch&#x27;?</h2><p>
<tt> evolve_batch</tt> is  a  command  line  utility.  It  runs  on  linux,  macos  and  windows.  The  primary  purpose  is  to  run  a
 simulation  from  a  shell.  See  the  section  on <A HREF="evolve_batch.html">Evolve  Batch</A> for  more  information.
</p>
<HR>
<A NAME="TOC21"></A><h2> How  fast  is  the  Evolve  simulator?</h2><p>
 Assuming  a  2.0  Ghz  machine,  then  a  simulation  with  a  population  of  3,000  will  produce  100  steps/sec.  (a  population  of
 6,000  will  give  50  steps/sec.).
</p>
<p>
 Every  day  you  can  expect  about  3  to  5  million  simulation  steps  to  elapse.
</p>
<p>
 Every  4  or  5  days  you  can  expect  about  1  billion  births/deaths.
</p>
<HR>
<A NAME="TOC22"></A><h2> How  long  can  simulations  be  run?  Are  there  any  overflow  considerations?</h2><p>
 The  C  data  type  used  for  counting  things  (like  number  of  births,  steps,  etc...)  all  use  64-bit  integers  instead  of
 the  more  standard  32-bit  integers.  This  effectively  removes  any  overflow  issues  associated  with  running  a  simulation  for  an  extended  period
 of  time  (Like  the  One  Year  of  Alife  project).  The  simulator  is  designed  to  be  saved  and  restored  without  losing
 any  state  changes.
