</ul><HR>
<A NAME="TOC4"></A><h2> Viewing  Organisms</h2><IMG  SRC="vobig.jpg"><p>
 Next  to  the  main  simulation  window,  this  is  the  second  most  important  display  in  the  simulator.  You  can  view  the
 entire  state  of  any  organism.  Shown  here  is  an  organism  that  consists  of  many  cells.  All  cells  share  the  same
 KFORTH  program.  However  each  cell  has  its  own  execution  context  (stack,  registers,  program  counter,  etc...).  This  means  different  cells  and
 be  executing  different  parts  of  the  same  genetic  program.
</p>
<p>
 You  can  click  on  each  cell  to  view  its  own  individual  state  information.  You  can  single  step  through  an  organism
 by  clicking  on &#x27;Step&#x27;.  Debugging  features  allow  you  to  completely  study  how  an  organism  works.
</p>
<HR>
<A NAME="TOC5"></A><h2> Vision  Data</h2><IMG  SRC="VisionDialog.jpg"><p>
 This  dialog  appears  when  you  click  on  the <b>[Vision]</b> tab  on  the  previous  dialog.  This  screen  allows  you  to  see
 the  distances  and  types  of  objects  that  the  cell  is  will &quot;see&quot; when  it  executes  a  vision  related  instruction  (such
 as &quot;LOOK&quot;).
</p>
<HR>
<A NAME="TOC6"></A><h2> Universe  Properties</h2><IMG  SRC="ViewUniverse.jpg"><p>
 This  dialog  just  summarizes  the  current  state  of  the  universe.  It  contains  a  useful  set  of  statistics  about  the  current
 simulation.  Memory  Usage  computes  how  much  RAM  is  being  used  internally  to  represent  this  simulation  (all  values  in  bytes).  We
 use  commas  to  display  numbers,  because  they  tend  to  get  very  large  and  this  makes  it  easier  to  read  them.
</p>
<p>
 Also,  Evolve  uses  64-bit  integers  (instead  of  32-bit),  this  effectively  eliminates  any  possibility  of  integer  overflow  during  an  extended  simulation
 run.
</p>
<HR>
<A NAME="TOC7"></A><h2> KFORTH  Interpreter</h2><IMG  SRC="KforthInterpreter.jpg"><p>
 This  dialog  lets  you  experiment  with  the  KFORTH  language.  You  can  write  simple  programs  and  single  step  through  them  to
 see  how  KFORTH  works.  This  dialog  shows  the  source  code  and  also  how  that  source  code  is  compiled  (in  the
 disassembly  window).
</p>
<p>
 The  basic  architecture  of  a  KFORTH  machine  is  a  DATA  stack  and  a  CALL  stack.  Also  each  KFORTH  machine  has
 10  general  purpose  registers  (&#x27;R0&#x27; - &#x27;R9&#x27;).  Each  data  value  is  a  signed  16-bit  integer.
</p>
<HR>
<A NAME="TOC8"></A><h2> KForth  Instructions  Help</h2><IMG  SRC="KforthInstructions.jpg"><p>
 You  can  get  help  for  all  the  KFORTH  instructions  (including  the  instructions  used  to  control  the  organisms).  This  dialog  is
 activated  when  the  user  clicks  on  the <b>[INSTRUCTIONS]</b> button.
</p>
<HR>
<A NAME="TOC9"></A><h2> New  Simulation</h2><IMG  SRC="NewUniverse.jpg"><p>
 This  dialog  is  used  to  create  a  new  simulation.  The  width  and  height  configures  the  size  of  your  universe.  Seed
 is  used  to  initialize  the  random  number  generator.  This  means  that  others  can  reproduce  your  results  by  using  the  same
 seed  number  (as  well  as  the  other  initial  settings  from  this  dialog).
</p>
<p>
 You  can  add  8  strains  to  a  new  simulation.  Each  strain  has  its  own  color,  and  you  can  see  which
 strains  succeed  over  time.  Strains  cannot  interbreed.
</p>
<p>
 The  KFORTH  program  is  the  initial  genetic  program  that  the  first  organism  starts  out  with.  Energy  is  the  amount  of
 energy  the  universe  will  have.  This  number  remains  constant  throughout  the  simulation.
</p>
<p>
 Rather  than  a  blank  rectangle  for  your  universe,  the &quot;Oval  Barrier&quot; will  place  a  oval  around  the  entire  universe.
</p>
<HR>
<A NAME="TOC10"></A><h2> Mutations</h2><IMG  SRC="SimulationOptions.jpg"><p>
 This  screen  lets  you  configure  the  mutations  rates.  Mutations  are  broken  down  into  several  types.  The  percentage  represents  the  probability
 that  that  type  of  mutation  will  occur  during  the  birth  of  an  organism.
</p>
<p>
 The  last  step  in  creating  a  new  organism  is  to  pass  its  genetic  program  (inherited  without  mutations  from  one  or
 two  parents)  through  our  mutation  algorithm.  This  algorithm  uses  these  percentages  to  determine  the  probability  that  one  of  these  errors
 will  be  introduced  into  the  new  organisms  genetic  program.
</p>
<HR>
<A NAME="TOC11"></A><h2> Protections</h2><IMG  SRC="StrainPropertiesDialogProt.jpg"><p>
 This  is  major  new  feature  in  Evolve  5.0.  It  allows  you  to  craft  a  mini  operating  system  for  your
 evolving  organism.  Protections  let  you  define  code  that <b>you</b> write  and  code  that <b>evolution</b> writes.  With  these  features  you  can
 sandbox  your  evolving  program  from  the  built  in  primitives  you  invent.
</p>
<HR>
<A NAME="TOC12"></A><h2> Modes</h2><IMG  SRC="StrainPropertiesDialogModes.jpg"><p>
 This  screen  lets  you  set  the  mode  bits  for  various  instructions.  Many  instructions  can  be  configured  in  various  ways.  Each
 mode  field  has  a  quick  help  link  to  easily  understand  how  to  use  all  the  flags.
</p>
<HR>
<A NAME="TOC13"></A><h2> Strain  Profiles</h2><IMG  SRC="StrainProfilesDialogNotes.jpg"><p>
 You  can  create  and  edit <b>Strain  Profiles</b> from  this  dialog.  A  strain  profile  stores  all  the  configuration  data  for  a  strain
 under  one  name.  You  can  re-use  strain  profiles  when  creating  new  simulations.
</p>
<HR>
<A NAME="TOC14"></A><h2> Find  Dialog</h2><IMG  SRC="FindDialog.jpg"><p>
 The  find  feature  is  a  powerful  tool  for  searching  your  simulation  using  complex  criteria.  (See <A HREF="find_dialog.html">Find  Dialog</A> to  learn  more).
</p>
<HR>
<A NAME="TOC15"></A><h2> Strain  Population</h2><IMG  SRC="StrainPopulation.jpg"><p>
 This  dialog  shows  the  population  of  each  strain  in  your  simulation.
</p>
<HR>
<A NAME="TOC16"></A><h2> Key</h2><CENTER><IMG BORDER=1 SRC="key.jpg""></CENTER><ul>
<li>
<b> Living  Cells:</b> These  are  cells  that  are  alive!  They  are  part  of  an  organism,  and  these  types  of  squares  can  move,
 look,  eat,  and  generally  do  what  living  things  do.
</li>

<li>
<b> Dead  Cells:</b> A  cell  that  has  just  died  will  be  colored  red.  Then  it  will  either  disappear  completely,  or  turn  in
 to &quot;food&quot; (a  white  square).
</li>

<li>
<b> Selected  Organism:</b> By  left  clicking  on  a  living  cell  the  user  can  select  an  organism.  A  selected  organism  can  be  copied,
 cut,  pasted,  or  examined.
</li>

<li>
<b> Food:</b> Food,  or  organic  material  is  created  when  an  organism  is  partially  killed  and  it  remains  are  left  behind.  This
 decaying  organic  material  contains  energy  and  can  be  eaten.
</li>

<li>
<b> Spores:</b> Organisms  create  spores  in  order  to  reproduce.  In  many  cases  the  first  spore  is  created  (shown  here  as  a
 blue  square),  but  the  spore  has  not  been  fertilized  yet.  These  spores  can  be  eaten,  or  another  organism  can  place
 another  spore  in  the  same  location,  which  will  create  a  new  organism.
</li>

<li>
<b> Barrier:</b> Barrier  can  be  created  by  the  user.  Organisms  cannot  pass  through  them.  Barriers  can  be  created  to  limit  migration
 of  organisms  between  different  regions.
</li>
