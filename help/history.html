<A NAME="TOC1"></A><h2>History  of  Evolve</h2><A NAME="TOC2"></A><h2> Timeline:</h2><ul>
<li>
<b> 1996  -  Evolve  1.0</b><br> Written  in  C  on  a  sun3  workstation.  No  visualization.  I  had  to  use  a  perl  script  to  convert  the
 simulation  to  Post  Script  and  then  use  GNU  GhostScript  (gs)  to  view  snapshots  of  the  universe.
</li><br>

<li>
<b> 1998  -  Evolve  2.0</b><br> Ported  the  original  code  to  Borland  Builder  C/C++  on  a  PC.  Implemented  a  decent  GUI  to  visualize  the  universe.
 Added  new  instructions,  and  tweaked  the  simulation.
</li><br>

<li>
<b> 2001  -  Evolve  3.0</b><br> Rewritten  in  Eiffel  as  a  learning  exercise.  Many  concepts  added  to  the  simulator  (like &quot;energy&quot; and &quot;barriers&quot;).  A  decent
 GUI  to  visualize  the  universe.  Added  new  instructions,  and  tweaked  the  simulation.
</li><br>

<li>
<b> 2006  -  Evolve  4.0</b><br> For  performance  reasons  Eiffel  was  dropped  as  the  implementation  and  another  complete  rewrite  in  C/C++.  This  time  the  genetic
 language  was  massively  improved,  and  SEX  was  added!!!!  None  of  the  original  code  was  reused  for  this  version.
</li><br>

<li>
<b> 2022  -  Evolve  5.0</b><br> This  version.  For  performance  reasons  64-bit  kforth  was  changed  to  16-bit.  New  UI.  Strain  Profiles.  another  complete  rewrite  in
 C  and  Swift.  More  ways  to  change  the  simulator  without  recompiling  the  simulator.
</li><br>
</ul><A NAME="TOC3"></A><h2> Version  1.0</h2><p>
 In  1996  I  read  a  wonderful  book  by  Richard  Dawkins, <i>The  Blind  Watchmaker</i> that  in  addition  to  providing  a  clear  description  of
 the  workings  of  evolution  it  also  described  some  interesting  computer  software  called <i>biomorphs</i>.  His  biomorphs  would  evolve  by  mutating
 a  small  set  of  genes  through  successive  generations.  However  the  selection  process  was  user  controlled.  The  user  selected  organisms  based
 on  whatever  criteria  they  wished.
</p>
<p>
 I  got  to  thinking  that  it  would  be  more  interesting  to  have  a  complete  simulation  of  evolution,  including  a  selection
 process  that  was  based  on  only  one  criteria: <b>Survival</b>.  I  also  wanted  a  more  sophisticated  mechanism  for  genes.  In
 biomprphs  the  genetics  were  limited  to  four  of  five  genes  (which  were  just  integers).
</p>
<p>
 Richard  Dawkins&#x27; description  of  the  power  of  cummulative  selection  was  so  convincing  that  I  imagined  that  a  sufficiently  good  simulation
 of  this  process  would  eventually  evolve  some  very &quot;smart&quot; creatures.  And  this  was  the  inspiration  for  this  software.
</p>
<p>
 My  idea  was  to  create  a  simple  2-dimensional  universe  using  finite  elements.  Conceptually  the  universe  would  consist  of  discrete  locations
 (Such  as  (0,0),  (5,4),  etc...).  There  would  not  be  any  bounds  to  this  universe  (a  feature  that  has  since  been
 dropped  in  version  4.0),  and  creatures  could  roam  in  virtually  unlimited  directions  North,  South,  East  and  West.  The  entities  that
 would  inhabit  this  simple  world  consisted  of  organisms.  Every  organism  would  occupy  one  or  more  locations.  The  organism  would  be
 a  series  of  cells  that  all  had  to  be  physically  located  next  to  each  other.
</p>
<p>
 Each  organism  would  consist  of  a  genetic  program.  Each  instruction  would  encapsulate  a  very  simple  operation.  For  example  the  instruction
<b>&quot;REPRODUCE  NORTH(#10)&quot;</b> would  cause  the  organism  to  spawn  a  copy  (with  possible  mutations)  10  units  north  of  the  cell  that  executed
 the  instruction.  Other  operations  included: <b>MOVE</b>, <b>CONSUME</b>, <b>NEW</b>, <b>DIE</b>.  To  make  the  range  of  behaviors  that
 could  evolve  more  interesting  I  included  GOTO  and  a  few  other  instructions  that  were  purely  programmatic  in  nature.
</p>
<p>
 In  1996,  I  had  a  spare  Sun3  workstation  that  I  hoped  to  run  this  simulator  for  months  at  a  time,
 and  periodically  I  would  examine  the  current  universe  to  see  what &quot;smart&quot; creatures  had  evolved.
</p>
<A NAME="TOC4"></A><h2> Version  2.0</h2><p>
 The  initial  version  was  not  very  good.  For  one  thing  I  didn&#x27;t  have  any  GUI.  The  only  way  to  examine
 the  universe  was  to  dump  the  state  of  the  universe  to  a  text  file.  I  had  to  use  a  perl
 script  that  converted  my  simulation  files  into  postscript  (which  I  could  then  view  using  Ghostscript).  But  the  results  and  interactivity
 was  lacking.
</p>
<p>
 So  two  years  later  in  1998  I  pulled  to  orginal  code  off  of  my  Sun  workstation  (which  was  headed  for
 a  Sunnyvale  landfill)  and  decided  to  port  it  to  Borland  Builder  C++.  It  was  very  easy  to  get  a  simple
 GUI  going  and  I  was  very  excited  to  run  a  simulation  and  be  able  to  see  the  simulation  results.
</p>
<p>
 During  this  time  I  enhanced  the  instruction  set.  I  realized  that  in  real-life  organisms,  each  cell  has  a  state  seperate
 from  the  other  cells.  You  nerve  cells  are  different  from  your  skin  cells.  I  added  registers  and  flags  and  a
 stack  to  each  cell.  The  genetic  program  was  shared  by  all  cells  in  the  organism  (just  like  our  DNA  is
 common  to  cells,  but  each  cell  does  different  things  based  on  state).
</p>
<p>
 I  continued  to  enhance  this  version.  I  added  many  nice  GUI  features  like  zoom,  cut/paste.  I  would  periodically  revisit  this
 program  and  run  simulations  for  a  couple  of  days  but  I  never  seemed  to  evolve  anything  very  interesting.
</p>
<p>
 One  of  the  problems  was  the  unbounded  universe.  The  creatures  would  just  move  in  a  single  direction  and  go  off
 into  inifinity.  My  model  for  rewarding  organisms  with  energy  if  they  consume  other  organisms  had  problems.  It  was  unstable.  Depending
 on  the  parameters  I  used,  I  either  got  an  exponential  growth  of  organisms  (and  the  machine  would  run  out  of
 memory).  Or  the  creatures  would  die  off  quickly.
</p>
<p>
 I  continued  to  tweak  my  universe  model.  I  added  a &quot;crowded  cells&quot; parameter  so  that  if  the  carrying  capacity  of
 the  simulation  reached  a  certain  level,  then  it  would  become  harder  and  harder  for  organisms  to  reproduce.  The  amount  of
 energy  needed  to  reproduce  would  dynamically  change  based  on  the  total  number  of  cells  in  the  universe.
</p>
<p>
 Anyway,  after  sufficient  tweaking  the  simulation  began  to  exhibit  the  characteristics  of  cummulative  selection,  and  I  was  happy.
</p>
<A NAME="TOC5"></A><h2> Version  3.0</h2><p>
 In  2001,  I  decided  to  re-implement  the  entire  simulator  application  in  Eiffel.  The  main  goal  was  to  learn  eiffel.  But
 I  made  several  improvements  to  the  program  during  this  time.  One  improvment  was  adding &quot;barriers&quot; to  the  universe.  A  BARRIER
 is  a  way  to  limit  the  universe  to  a  enclosed  region.  When  I  ran  the  simulator  with  an  enclosure,  I
 began  to  see  much  more  evolution  of  smart  creatures.  They  moved  around  more,  and  they  would  change  their  direction  and
 interact  strangely  with  other  creatures.
</p>
<p>
 Unfortunately  the  Eiffel  implementation  was  my  first  large  scale  Eiffel  program.  It  suffered  from  many  problems.  Mostly  it  couldn&#x27;t  handle
 the  constant  creation/destruction  of  objects  during  the  simulation.  I  love  Eiffel,  but  damn  if  this  app.  was  just  too  slow
 for  my  needs.
</p>
<A NAME="TOC6"></A><h2> Version  4.0</h2><p>
 In  2006,  I  rewrote  the  whole  thing  in  C/C++.  I  hate  C++,  but  I  guess  over  the  years  I  have
 warmed  up  to  it  enough  to  use  it.  I  do  appreciate  C++&#x27;s  performance  advantage  over  Eiffel.  And  with  lots  and
 lots  of  ASSERT()&#x27;s  you  can  protect  yourself  from  endless  hours  of  debugging.
</p>
<p>
 Version  4.0  is  much  improved:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
 Uses  a  Forth-like  genetic  language.
</li>

<li>
 Each  cell  can  execute  in  a  virtual  machine  with  unlimited  data/call  stack
</li>

<li>
 Made  replication  a  2-step  process  involving  spores,  and  supports  both  sexual  and  asexual  reproduction.
</li>

<li>
 Cleaner  GUI.
</li>

<li>
 Simulation  files  are  platform  independent.
</li>

<li>
 The  command  line  simulator  can  run  on  Linux  (or  any  unix)  as  well  as  windows.
</li>

<li>
 More  accessable  source  code  for  better  hacking.  (Eiffel  is  still  kind  of  a  niche  language  for  most  hackers).
</li>

<li>
 More  flexible  instructions  for  controlling  the  organism
</li>

<li>
 A  better  LOOK  primitive  which  is  not  limited  to  up/down/left/right  directions.
</li>

<li>
 Grid  movement  is  extended  to  include  diagonals.  (not  limited  to  up,  down,  left  and  right  anymore)
</li>

<li>
 Much  faster  than  previous  implementations.
</li>
</ul><A NAME="TOC7"></A><h2> Version  5.0</h2><p>
 In  2022,  I  was  motivated  to  re-release  this  again.  I  was  reminded  that  this  software  exists.  I  had  no  way
 to  run  this  software  anymore.  I  didn&#x27;t  have  a  windows  machine.  I  couldn&#x27;t  even  run  the  old  executables.  But  I
 really  wanted  to  play  with  this  software  again!  So  I  decided  to  port  it  to  MacOS,  and  learn  a  new
 platform  /  langugae  /  IDE.
</p>
<p>
 Version  5.0  is  much  improved  again:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
 Uses  modern  native  GUI  on  the  Mac
</li>

<li>
 Higher  Performance  due  to  improved  simulator  code  using  data  driven  design  principles
</li>

<li>
 More  instructions,  especially  LOOK&#x27;ing
</li>

<li>
 More  capabilities  to  perform  on  the  2d  grid:  SHOUT,  LISTEN,  SMELL,  EXUDE,  ROTATE
</li>

<li>
 Relaxed  connectivity  contraints  such  that  diagonal  creatures  are  allowed
</li>

<li>
 More  modes  for  configuring  the  behavior  of  instructions
</li>

<li>
 Ability  to  create  strain  profiles
</li>

<li>
 Ability  to  enable/disable  kforth  instructions
</li>

<li>
 Unmutable  code  regions  -  specify  that  certain  regions  of  your  kforth  program  will  not  be  mutated
</li>

<li>
 Much  faster  than  previous  implementations.
</li>

<li>
 interactivity  via  MOUSE-POS  and  KEY-PRESS  instructions
</li>

<li>
 much  improved  internal  organization  for  code  maintainence
</li>
</ul><HR>
