<A NAME="TOC1"></A><h1>About  this  Software</h1><p>
<b> Evolve  5.0</b> is  a  simulator  of  evolution  using  cells  on  a  2-dimensional  universe.  Each  cell  is  a  computer  CPU  running  a
 program.  These  programs  can  replicate,  move  and  struggle  for  resources.  This  software  lets  you  create  new  simulations,  run  them,  and
 visualize  the  behavior  of  the  evolving  creatures.
</p>
<p>
 This  is  a  simulator  with  a  heavy  emphasis  on <b>programming</b>.  The  USER  is  responsible  for  writing  serious  16-bit  forth
 programs  in  a  large  compute  space  with  thousands  of  replicating  programs.  This  software  provides  a  robust  development  environment  for  creating
 such  programs.
</p>
<p>
 The  first  version  of  this  software  was  created  in  1996.  Fortunately,  it  has  evolved  (just  like  the  creatures  that  live
 in  the  simulator)  into  an  awsome  piece  of  software.  The  most  recent  version  is  a  complete  MacOS  application  with  a
 well  designed  GUI  and  lots  of  features  for  examining  the  evolved  creatures.
</p>
<p>
 I  have  prepared  a  quick  overview  of  the  software <A HREF="overview.html">here</A>.

<A NAME="TOC3"></A><h2> Requirements</h2> The  GUI  software  runs  on  MacOS.  The  command  line  utility  (no  graphics)  runs  on  MacOS,  Windows  and  Linux.  This  application
 is  written  in  C  &amp;  Swift  using  Xcode.  It  was  written  as  an <b>NSDocument</b> style  application.<p>
 Oh  yeah,  one  more  requirement:  You  will  need  a  complete  Bio  Hazard  Level  4  facility  to  run  this  software.

<A NAME="TOC4"></A><h2> Description</h2><p>
 This  program  is  a  simulator  of  artificial  life.  A  virtual  universe  is  created  that  supports  the  basics  of  evolution:  Replicators
 and  cummulative  selection.  On  the  Internet,  the  ALIFE  community  includes  a  lot  of  software  all  trying  to  do  related  things.
 There  are  two  main  categories  of  ALIFE  software:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<b> Primordial  Soup  simulations:</b> These  simulators  begin  with  simple  rules  and  attempt  to  cause  the  emergence  of  replicators.  (I.e,  Conways  Life)
</li><br>

<li>
<b> Artifical  life:</b> The  machinery  for  replication  is  the  starting  point.  And  the  goal  is  to  evolve  better  and  better  replicators.
</li><br>
</ol><p>
<b> Evolve  5.0</b> is  an  example  of  (2).  Replication  and  mutations  are  built  into  the  system.  There  is  a  loose  connection  between
 real  world  biology  and  the  organisms  in  Evolve.  Cells  can  grow  into  multicellular  organism  in  Evolve.  A  cell  is  just
 a  block  on  the  grid.  It  contains  a  CPU  core  running  a  shared  program.
</p>
<p>
 This  simulator  is  a  union  of <i>Conway&#x27;s  Game  of  Life</i> and <i>Core  Wars</i>.  The  game  of  life  presents  a  simple  2-dimensional  universe,  with
 some  basic  rules  that  cells  in  the  universe  follow  (Evolve  has  a  slightly  more  complex  set  of  rules).  Core  wars
 is  a  virtual  computer  running  many  programs  (written  in  REDCODE)  in  a  shared  memory  space  (called  core).  Each  program  tries
 to  copy  itself  and  crowd  out  other  programs.
</p>
<p>
 Evolve  uses  a  sophisticated  forth-like  language  (called  KFORTH)  for  the  control  of  organisms  and  cells.  This  is  the  analog  of
 our  DNA.  The  size  of  these  programs  is  unbounded  and  therefore  very  complex  behaviors  can  evolve.  KFORTH  programs  do  not
 run  in  a  shared  memory  space  rather,  each  cell  has  its  own  virtual  computing  machine  that  includes  a  data  and
 call  stack  plus  some  working  registers.  An  organism  can  have  many  cells  all  executing  different  parts  of  the  same  genetic
 program.  It  is  therefore  possible  for  cells  to  specialize  their  function,  and  thus  achieve  even  more  complex  behaviors.
</p>
<A NAME="TOC5"></A><h3> Differences  from  other  ALife  software:</h3><p>
 Most  artifical  life  simulators  use  a  very  restricted  genetic  layout.  One  program  for  example,  called &quot;Darwin  Pond&quot; has  about  8
 or  9  genes  which  are  simple  floating  point  numbers.  All  the  logic  for  reproduction  and  consumption  and  movement  are  hard
 coded  in  the  simulation.  There  is  very  little  genetic  variation  that  can  occur.  The  genetic  programming  language  for  Evolve  is
 unlimited  in  size  and  therefore  extremely  advanced  behavior  for  organisms  can  emerge.
</p>
<p>
 Biomorphs  also  have  a  limited  set  of  genes,  and  the  selection  process  is  through  user  interaction.  In  the  Evolve  program,
 the  selection  process  is  part  of  the  simulation.
</p>
<p>
 Other  ALife  simulators  run  short  scenarios  with  a  small  handful  of  organisms,  and  then  after  a  fixed  period  of  simulation
 time,  the  best  organisms  are  retained  and  the  rest  are  eliminated.  Then  a  new  scenario  is  started.  The  Evolve  simulator
 is  more  realistic.  In  Evolve  there  is  a  virtual  universe  in  which  thousands  of  organisms  live  and  reproduce.  The  simulations
 you  will  run  are  intended  to  run  for  billions  of  simulations  steps,  with  billions  of  births  and  deaths.
</p>

 Evolve  has  been  in  development  since  1996.  Read  about  the  history  of  Evolve  5.0, <A HREF="history.html">here</A>.
