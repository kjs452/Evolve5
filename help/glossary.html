<A NAME="TOC1"></A><h1> Glossary</h1><p>
 Some  terms  and  concepts  used  by  the  simulator  software.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b> Code  Block</b> -  Part  of  a  KFORTH  program.  Each  row  of  the  kforth  program  is  a  code  block.  The  first  code
 block  is  labeled &#x27;main()&#x27;,  and  is  where  program  execution  begins.  Other  code  blocks  are  labeled  by  their  row  number.  I.e.,
&#x27;row5&#x27;.  Learn  about  the  kforth  languge <A HREF="kforth.html">here</A>.
</li><br>

<li>
<b> Program  Counter</b> -  (pc).  This  is  the  offset  into  the  code  block.  Taken  together  (cb,  pc)  forms  a  complete  address  referring
 to  a  KFORTH  program  memory  location.
</li><br>

<li>
<b> Universe</b> -  refers  to  the  overall  simulation.  But  it  can  also  refer  to  the  grid  in  which  all  the  cells
 and  other  blocks  are  located.
</li><br>

<li>
<b> Organism</b> -  The  simulator  manages  a  list  of  organisms.  The  organism  object  contains  a  KFORTH  genetic  program  and  a  list
 of  cells  which  are  all  part  of  this  organism  and  running  the  same  program.
</li><br>

<li>
<b> Cell</b> -  The  simulator  manages  a  list  of  cells.  Only  cells  run  programs  and  are  given  simulation  time.  Every  time
 the  simulator  is  called  (See <b><tt>UNIVERSE_Simulate()</tt></b>)  it  executes <b>1</b> instruction  from  the  next  cell  in  the  list.  And  then
 the  next  cell  and  so  on.  When  all  cells  are  simulated,  we  return  to  the  beginning.
</li><br>

<li>
<b> Spore</b> -  Spores  are  special  cells  placed  on  the  grid.  They  are  shown  in  light  blue.  They  contain  the  genetic
 KFORTH  program  of  the  cell  that  created  them.  Spores  can  be  fertilized  with  a  second  genetic  program.  After <A HREF="mutations.html">merging  and  mutating</A> a
 new  organism  is  spawned  and  added  to  the  list  of  cells.
</li><br>

<li>
<b> Organic  Material</b> -  This  is  the  name  given  to  a  simple  block  on  the  grid  that  just  contains  some  energy. <i>Organic  Material</i> blocks  appear  in  the  simulation  windows  as  white  blocks  with  a  black  border.  Organic  blocks  can  be  created  by  the
 instruction <tt>MAKE-ORGANIC</tt>.  But  usually  an  organic  block  is  created  when  an  organism  dies  or  parts  of  the  orgasism  dies
 and  the  disconnected  cells  are  converted  to  organic  material. <p>
Organic  material  is  a  resource,  as  it  can  be  EAT&#x27;en  which  provides  energy.
</p>

</li><br>

<li>
<b> Barrier</b> -  The  simulation  universe  can  be  broken  up  into  regions  by  placing  barriers  around  the  grid.  The  barriers  are
 simply  blocks  which  cannot  be  moved  through.  There  is  an  instruction  to  create  barriers, <tt>MAKE-BARRIER</tt>,  but  this  is  often
 protected  because  during  evolution  is  ruins  the  simulation.  Too  many  barriers  get  created.  The  MAKE-BARRIER  instruction  should  be  protected  and
 used  as  part  of  a  custom  simulation.
</li><br>

<li>
<b> Energy</b> -  Many  cells  on  the  grid  have  energy.  All  energy  is  conserved  during  the  execution  of  the  simulator.  This
 is  accomplished  by <b>always  moving</b> energy  from  one  cell  to  another,  never  creating  or  destroying  it. <p>
Energy  is  required  to  exist  as  an  organism  with  cpu  cycles.  This  can  be  used  to  control  the  simulation  from
 getting  too  many  organisms  and  grinding  to  a  halt.
</p>
<p>
 Very  few  operations  require  energy.  The  GROW,  MAKE-SPORE,  and  SPAWN  instructions  do.  They  also  have  mode  settings  to  specify  how
 much  energy  is  required.
</p>
<p>
 The  instructions  which  take  energy  are <tt>EAT</tt> and <tt>SEND-ENERGY</tt>.  EAT  is  a  more  generic  and  friendly  interface  to  the
 eating  operation.  It  has  tons  of  modes  to  control  how  much  eating  occurs.  Or  how  aggressive  it  is.  SEND-ENERGY  is
 a  lower  level  operation.  It  just  moves  the  amount  of  energy  specified  between  cells.  This  instruction  can  be  used  to
 implement  your  own  rules.
</p>

</li><br>

<li>
<b> KFORTH</b> -  Stands  for  Ken&#x27;s  Forth.  It  is  the  programming  language  used  by  this  simulator.  The  cell&#x27;s  are  controlled  by
 KFORTH  programs  which  determine  the  behaviors  of  the  cells.  Kforth  derives  from  the  language  known  as <i>forth</i>.  It  is
 a  16-bit  architecture  with  the  ability  to  address  256  MB  of  memory.  It  has  TRAP&#x27;s  for  implementing  system  calls.  It
 has  interupts.  It  has  protected  mode  and  user  land  mode.
</li><br>

<li>
<b> KFORTH  Program</b> -  A  program  written  in  KFORTH.  The  seed  file  provided  for  each  Strain  Profile  is  a  kforth  program.  Kforth
 programs  are  stored  in  files  as  plain  text.  Usually  the  file  extension  is <b>.kf</b>.
</li><br>

<li>
<b> Stack,  Data</b> -  A  data  structure  inside  of  each  cell  for  storing  the  results  of  the  program  execution.  The  stack  is
 fixed  size,  with  a  length  of <b>64</b> elements.  When  full  the  cell  cannot  push  new  items  on  the  stack  and
 all  instructions  behave  like  NO-OP&#x27;s
</li><br>

<li>
<b> Stack,  Call</b> -  Another  data  structure  inside  of  each  cell.  This  stores  the  prior  program  location <b>(cb,  pc)</b> for  returning  from  subroutines.
 This  stack  is  limited  to <b>64</b> elements.  When  full,  no  more  subroutines  can  be  called.
</li><br>

<li>
<b> Radio  Active  Tracer</b> -  This  is  a  fancy  name  for  marking  things  in  the  simulation.  They  are  marked  with  a  green  outline
 which  looks  radio-active.  It  is  analogous  to  tracer  chemicals/isotopes  used  in  real  medicine.  The  idea  is  to  see  where  an
 organism  goes  and  observe  all  of  its  offspring.
</li><br>

<li>
<b> Selected  Organism</b> -  This  is  the  organism  the  user  has  selected  in  the  simulation  window.
</li><br>

<li>
<b> Instruction</b> -  A  KFORTH  program  consists  of  numbers  and  instructions.  An  instruction  is  one  of  about  160  built-in  primitives  of
 the  simulator.  Examples  of  instructions  are, <tt>+  -  /  negate  dup  pop  ifelse,  TRAP9,  OMOVE</tt>.
</li><br>

<li>
<b> Strain</b> -  Evolve  5.0 supports  8  strains  within  the  same  simulation.  These  strains  are  numbered  0  to  7.  A  strain
 is  a  collection  of  customizations.
</li><br>

<li>
<b> Strain  Profile</b> -  A  strain  that  has  been  saved  for  re-use.  It  is  given  a  name  and  is  stored  in  the
 users <tt>~/.evolve5rc</tt> file.
</li><br>

<li>
<b> Evolve  Preferences</b> -  A  file  to  hold  strain  profiles  and  other  application  data <b><tt>~/.evolve5rc</tt></b>
</li><br>

<li>
<b> Mutate  Program</b> -  The  process  by  which  a  KFORTH  program  is  modifed  during  copying.  Mutations  are  one  or  more  small  random
 modifications  to  the  program.
</li><br>

<li>
<b> Merge  Program</b> -  Two  program  can  be  merged  by  merging  the  code  blocks.  Interlacing  them  or  randomly  interlacing  them  are  posible
 modes.
</li><br>

<li>
<b> Normalized  Coordinate</b> -  (x,y)  coordinate  which  refer  to  the  immediate  neighboring  cells.  These  are  coordinate  with  the  values  -1,  0,  and
 1.  Such  as  (-1,  0),  (0,  1),  (1,  1),  etc...
</li><br>

<li>
<b> Normalized  Vector</b> -  Similar  to  a  Normalize  Coordinate  except  the  important  information  is  the  direction,  not  the  neighboring  square.  So  for
 example  the  normalized  vector  (1,  1)  refers  to  the  direction  north  and  east  (up  and  to  the  left).
</li><br>

<li>
<b> Seed</b> -  A  value  used  to  initialize  the  random  number  generator  at  the  creation  of  the  simulation.
</li><br>

<li>
<b> Seed  Program</b> -  A  KFORTH  program  that  is  used  as  the  starting  program  for  an  initial  organism  in  a  new  simulation.
</li><br>

<li>
<b> Starting  Population</b> -  Refers  to  how  many  organisms  you  want  to  start  the  simulation  with.
</li><br>

<li>
<b> Simulation  Steps</b> -  Refers  to  how  many  times  the  C  API  routine <tt>UNIVERSE_Simulate()</tt> has  been  called.  This  API  will  simulate <b>1</b> cell  for <b>1</b> instruction.
</li><br>

<li>
<b> Age,  of  Universe</b> -  Refers  to  the  number  of  times  the  universe  has  simulated  every  cell  in  the  cell  list.  This  increments
 slower  than  the <b>Step</b> variable.
</li><br>

<li>
<b> Age,  of  Organism</b> -  Refers  to  the  age  of  an  organism.  One  of  each  organisms  properties  is  how  many  steps  it  has
 been  alive.  This  value  is  incremented  each  time  all  of  its  cells  have  been  simulated  for  1  step.
</li><br>

<li>
<b> Register</b> -  Each  cell  has  10  registers  for  storing  temporary  values.  These  registers  hold  a  16-bit  signed  value.  There  are
 instrutions  to  increment  and  decrement  registers.
</li><br>

<li>
<b> Protected  Code  Block</b> -  A  code  block  in  the  protected  region  of  the  KFORTH  program.  A  protected  code  block  will  not  be
 mutated.  Nor  will  information  leak  out  of  it  during  mutations.  And  other  properties  that  allow  for  sandboxing  custom  code  from
 evolving  code.
</li><br>

<li>
<b> Protected  Instruction</b> -  An  instruction  which  has  been  marked &quot;protected&quot; by  ther  user.  These  instructions  will  not  be  generated  by  the
 mutation  algorithm.  They  can  be  used  in  the  protected  region  and  made  unavailable  to  the  evolving  code.
</li><br>

<li>
<b> KFORTH  Program  Literal</b> -  A  number  stored  in  the  program  memory.  NOTE:  This  is  a <b>15-bit  signed  value</b>.  Program  Literals  are  15-bits...  Deal
 with  it.  They  are  stored  in  the  same  space  as  the  instructions.
</li><br>

<li>
<b> KFORTH  Opcode</b> -  An  instruction  stored  in  the  program  memory.  See  the  instructions <tt>OPCDOE</tt>, <tt>OPCODE!</tt>, <tt>OPCODE&#x27;</tt>.
</li><br>

<li>
<b> KFORTH  Instruction</b> -  Same  term  as &quot;KFORTH  Opcode&quot;.
</li><br>

<li>
<b> Trap</b> -  A  trap  is  a  way  for  un-protected  code  to  call  out  to  protected  code.  Traps  use  code  block
 rows:  row1,  row2, ...  row9.  Instructions:  TRAP1  thru  TRAP9  call  the  code  blocks  row1  thru  row9.
</li><br>

<li>
<b> Interrupt</b> -  Alters  the  execution  flow  control  for  a  cell  to  a  TRAP  handler.  The  condition  that  triggers  an  Interrupt
 is  due  to  another  cell  execution  an  instruciton  which  affects  another  cell.  Interrupts  must  be  enabled  by  setting  mode  bits.
</li><br>

<li>
<b> Instruction  Modes</b> -  Many  important  instructions,  such  a  EAT,  SEND,  MAKE-SPORE,  and  SPAWN,  can  have  their  behavior  altered.  You  use <i>Instruction  Modes</i> to  do  this.  They  consists  of  one  or  more  switched  which  can  be  independently  turned  on/off.  Each  strain  can  configure
 these  mode  bits  independently  of  each  other.
