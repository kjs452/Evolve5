<A NAME="TOC1"></A><h2> New  Universe  Dialog</h2><p>
 This  dialog  is  for  creating  a  new  universe/simulation.
</p>
<IMG  SRC="NewUniverse.jpg"><p>
 Pick  any  old  random  value  for  the  seed.  By  default  the  a  new  seed  is  selected  by  calling  GetTickCount()  from
 the  operating  system.  But  you  can  enter  a  value  here.  The  seed  can  be  used  to  reproduce  a  simulation  (of
 course  the  other  settings  must  also  be  the  same).
</p>
<p>
 You  can  select  any  width  and  height  you  wish  (up  to  a  maximum  of  3000  units).  You  can  leave  the
 defaults  500  x  500  or,  as  shown  here,  use  700  x  500.  The  Oval  Barrier  option  will  create  a  pleasant
 enclosure  for  your  universe  (instead  of  a  bare  rectangle).  This  enclosure  may  be  erased  later  and  you  can  draw  new
 barriers  when  the  simulation  window  appears.
</p>
<A NAME="TOC2"></A><h2> Terrain  File</h2><p>
 The  terrain  file  is  another  simulation  file  which  has <b>barriers</b>.  Those  barriers  will  be  used  to  initialize  the  new
 universe  created  with  this  dialog.  For  example  an  hand  drawn  barrier  pattern  which  you  want  to  re-use  can  be  saved
 as  its  own  file,  and  supplied  here.
</p>
<p>
 The  barriers  in  the  terrain  file  will  be  scaled  to  fit  the  dimensions  of  the  new  universe  (width  x  height).
</p>
<p>
 The <A HREF="evolve_batch.html">Evolve  Batch</A> utility  can  generate  terrain  from  an  image  file  using  the  pixel  data  to  map  to  barriers.  It  will
 generate  a  minimal  simulation  file  that  can  be  supplied  here  for  the  terrain.
</p>
<A NAME="TOC3"></A><h2> Starting  Population</h2><p>
 Here  you  specify  the  starting  population.  This  consists  of  up  to  8 &quot;strains&quot;.  Each  strain  is  a  starting  organism  which
 will  not  interbreed  with  the  other  strains.  Its  color  and  strain  value  will  follow  the  creature,  and  its  offspring  for
 the  lifetime  of  the  simulation.
</p>
<p>
 Unless  you  know  how  to  write  KFORTH  programs,  it  will  be  best  to  select &#x27;seed.kf&#x27; which  is  the  starting  program
 I  use  for  all  my  simulations.  This  is  text  file  which  you  can  look  at  using  the &quot;KFORTH  Interpreter&quot;.
</p>
<p>
 Energy  is  an  important  value  for  controlling  the  population  of  your  universe.  The  default  (1,000,000)  is  kind  of  high,  man.
 Values  between  100,000  to  300,000  will  give  you  a  population  of  about  1,000  -  5,000  organisms.  Here  we  have  entered
 150,000.
</p>
<p>
 You  can  clear  a  strain  row  by  selecting <b>--blank--</b> from  the  strain  profile  combo  box.
</p>
<p>
 Oh,  please  note  that  commas  are  allowed  inside  of  these  edit  controls.  (Cool  eh?)
</p>
<p>
<A NAME="TOC4"></A><h2> Mutation  Settings</h2> Clicking  on  this  button  will  bring  up  the  Mutation  Settings  Dialog.  This  will  allow  you  to  configure  the  mutation
 probabilities.  The  defaults  should  be  sufficient.  This  is  the  dialog  that  will  appear:
</p>
<IMG  SRC="SimulationOptions.jpg"><A NAME="TOC5"></A><h2> Starting  Locations</h2><p>
 If  your  simulation  consists  of  only  1  strain,  then  that  organism  will  be  placed  in  the  center  of  the  simulation
 grid.  If  2  or  more  starting  organisms  are  selected,  they  will  be  placed  uniformly  around  the  simulation  grid.
</p>
<CENTER><IMG  SRC="placement.gif"></CENTER><CENTER><I> placement  of  starting  organism</I></CENTER><BR><p>
 This  diagram  shows  8  locations.  This  shows  the  placement  when  more  than  one  strain  has  been  specified.  The  first  strain
 you  specify  will  be  placed  in  square  1.  The  second  strain  you  specify  will  be  placed  in  square  2.  And
 so  on...  These  numbers  ARE  not  strain  numbers.  The  placement  is  based  on  how  many  strains  have  been  specified.  The
 order  is  the  to  to  bottom  order  in  the  dialog.
</p>
<A NAME="TOC6"></A><h2> Competition  Modes</h2><p>
 Strains  allow  Evolve  to  be  used  for  games.  Three  variants  can  be  played  are:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<b> Arena  Bot  Battle:</b> Each  strain  is  one  of  the  competing  bots  (robots).  One  of  the  rules  is  that  no  bot  can  have
 MAKE-SPORE  in  its  genetic  code.  This  means  bots  will  not  be  able  to  reproduce.  The  goal  is  to  see  which
 bot  can  kill  the  other  bots.  You  run  this  kind  of  simulation  until  only  one  competitor  remains.
</li>

<li>
<b> Army  Hoard  Bot  Battle:</b> Similar  to  regular  bot  battles,  but  the  robots  can  multiply  using  the  MAKE-SPORE  instruction.  Mutations  are  set  to &quot;0%&quot;,
 however.  This  means  no  evolution  takes  place.  This  allows  you  to  design  a  genetic  program  which  includes  group  behaviors  and
 swarming  tactics.
</li>

<li>
<b> Survival  of  the  fittest:</b> In  this  game  mode,  you  run  a  simulation  to  see  if  your  strain  can  outcompete  other  strains.  You  permit
 MAKE-SPORE,  and  mutations  are  enabled.
</li>

<li>
<b> Arcade  Games:</b> You  can  build  simple  2D  arcade  games.  By  using  the <tt>KEY-PRESS</tt> and <tt>MOUSE-POS</tt> instructions,  you  can  craft  programs  and
 cells  which  respond  to  keyboard  and  mouse  information.  With  this  a  primitive  game  can  be  written  in  which  you  roam
 around  and  shoot  things.
</li>
</ol><A NAME="TOC7"></A><h2> Starting  Populations</h2><p>
 To  create  a  strain  with  more  than  one  organism,  you  can  specify  a  number  between  1  and  100  in  the
 Population  field  (<b>Pop.</b>).  Here  is  how  the  population  will  be  initialized:
